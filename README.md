# Air Quality Prediction

This project explores using machine learning to predict air quality, specifically focusing on PM2.5 concentration.

### Project Setup:
1- This project utilizes Google Colab for running the Python code.
2- The Colab notebook file (e.g., airqualityprediction.ipynb) is included within this repository.

### Libraries Used:
1- pandas
2- numpy
3- seaborn
4- matplotlib

### Data:
The project requires a dataset containing air quality measurements. You'll need to obtain this data from a credible source and upload it to your environment.
Ensure the data includes factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and PM2.5 concentration.

## Code Overview

### 1- Data Loading & Preprocessing:
1- Load the air quality data from your uploaded CSV file.
2- Preprocess the data by handling missing values and outliers, and converting categorical variables (if any) into numerical values.

### 2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1- Analyze the data to understand the relationships between various factors and air quality.
2- Visualize the data using scatter plots or other techniques to identify trends.

### 3- Model Training & Evaluation:
1- Split the data into training and testing sets.
2- Train a linear regression model to predict PM2.5 concentration based on other features.
3- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 4- Prediction:
1- Use the trained model to predict PM2.5 values for new data
